        <h2>Whad do I do?</h2>

        <p>
        Well, if I had a nickel for every time someone asked me that and regretted it afterward,
        I'd probably be retired by now, sipping piña coladas on a beach.
        But alas, here I am, a software engineer.
        Think of me as the digital architect who turns coffee into code, and bugs into feature requests.
        So, whether I'm untangling the mysteries of the digital realm or just trying to figure out what my code meant at 2 AM,
        one thing's for sure: I'm here to make technology bend to our will – or at least attempt to!
        </p>
        <p>
        Here are a few of the technologies that I work with:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                    PHP
                    <ul>
                            <li>
                                Symfony
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                API-Platform
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Doctrine ORM
                            </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                GO
                <ul>
                        <li>
                        GIN
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        GORM
                        </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>RabbitMQ</li>

            <li>MariaDB</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why does this website look like this? Is it broken?</h3>

        <p>
        This look is intentional. I thought long and hard about how I would make my personal website. I could've definetly
        whipped up some css to make it look cool but, as you might have guessed from my tech stack,
        I mostly focus on backend. I thought this might be effective enough in scaring away recruiters
        trying to find somebody to work on their fad JavaScript framework website.
        </p>
        <p> And, as <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">mfw</a> reminds us, this kind of website checks all the usual boxes:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>It's responsive.</li>
        <li>It's fast and light.</li>
        <li>It will work on any device (and any browser).</li>
        <li>It's easily indexed.</li>
        </ul>
